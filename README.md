# A Matlab Exercise / Project

**This is a Matlab project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This scripts was created for the seventh semester class Image Analysis 
and it is the final project necessary to pass the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>Matlab scripts that implement necessary algorithmic procedures to automatically color a black and white image. In particular, you need to develop code to perform some computing activities:
>

> #### Implementation of project
>
> 1. Image Representation in Color Lab Space
> 2. Dissect the Color Lab on the basis of a set of related training images.
> 3. Image segmentation in Superpixels according to the SLIC algorithm.
> 4. Export SURF Features & Gabor Features per Super Pixel.
> 5. Learning Local Color Forecast Models Using SVM Classifiers
> 6. Estimation of Color Content in Black and White Using Graphics Cutting Algorithms.

> #### About this project
>
> - Steps 5 & 6 are partly implemented
> - This program was written in Matlab IDE
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
